This tool measures the total information leaks for a program with some choosen high inputs by the user.


Folder/file Structure


1. benchmarks - it containts the benchmarks in FSMD (finite state machine with datapaths) format 

1.1. filename.org - the original/source FSMD 

1.2. filename.opt - the optimized FSMD generated from the source program

1.3. Input.txt - the list of inputs to the source and optimized FSMDs

1.4. High.txt - the list of selected high inputs from the input list (update this file to run for different high inputs)



2. bin - it containts the executable and high/sensitive input file

2.1. quantifyleak - the executable to run our tool



How to run?

Use the following command from the bin directory to run our tool

./quantifyleak ../benchmarks/benchmarkname/filename ../benchmarks/benchmarkname/High.txt



Note: Currently, mention only one high input in the High.txt file from the Input.txt for the choosen benchmark.
