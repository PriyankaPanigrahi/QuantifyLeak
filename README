This tool measures the total information leaks for a program with some choosen high inputs by the user.

Folder/file Structure

1. benchmarks - it containts the benchmarks in FSMD (finite state machine with datapaths) format and their inputs

1.1. benchmarkname.org - the original/source FSMD 

1.2. benchmarkname.opt - the optimized FSMD generated from the optimized program. The optimized program is generated from the source program in SPARK compiler.

1.3. Input.txt - the list of inputs to the source and optimized FSMDs

1.4. High.txt - the list of selected high inputs from the input list (update this file to run for different high inputs)

2.1. bin/quantifyleak - the executable to run our tool

How to run?

Use the following command from the bin directory to run our tool

./quantifyleak ../benchmarks/benchmarkname/filename ../benchmarks/benchmarkname/High.txt

Note: Currently, mention only one high input in the High.txt file from the Input.txt for the choosen benchmark.
